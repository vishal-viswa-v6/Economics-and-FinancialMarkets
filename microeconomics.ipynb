    "#### Scarcity from an economic standpoint is limited resources such as compute, time and land. How do we make decisions when there is unlimited demand and limited supply? The concept of trade-offs is how decisions are made under scarcity, for example, when choosing between BTC and ETH with a total of 1000 USD in your bank, if you bought 1000 USD worth of BTC, you do not own any ETH and this is known as opportunity cost. What are you choosing to sacrifice when you pick one option over the other? This is the fundemental logic behind microeconomics and scarcity."
